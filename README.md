Sandbox Project: Understanding How TLS Works
This project will help you:

Set up an HTTPS server with a self-signed TLS certificate.
Establish a secure connection between a client and the server.
Understand key TLS concepts like certificates, private keys, and encryption.

### Steps for the Project

1. Generate a Self-Signed TLS Certificate
   Use openssl to generate a self-signed certificate.

```bash
# Generate a private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048

# Generate a self-signed certificate
openssl req -new -x509 -key server.key -out server.crt -days 365
```

This will create two files:

- server.key: The private key.
- server.crt: The self-signed certificate.

#### decipher what is in your .cert file

Use a tool like open source
[CyberChef - Parse X.509
certificate](<https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=Parse_X.509_certificate('PEM')>)
to decrypt and peek into your .cert file. You will be interested to get
information about its expiration date and its issuer

2. Create an HTTPS Server
   Use Python's http.server and ssl modules to set up an HTTPS server.

```python
import ssl
from http.server import HTTPServer, SimpleHTTPRequestHandler

# Configure the HTTPS server
server_address = ('localhost', 4443)
httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, SimpleHTTPRequestHandler)

# Load the certificate and private key
context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER)
context.load_cert_chain(certfile="server.crt", keyfile="server.key")

# Wrap the server socket with SSL
httpd.socket = context.wrap_socket(httpd.socket, server_side=True)

print("HTTPS server running at https://localhost:4443")
httpd.serve_forever()
```

3. Create an HTTPS Client
   Use Python's requests library to create a client that connects to the HTTPS server.

```python
import requests

# Disable warnings for self-signed certificates (for sandbox purposes only)
import urllib3
urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)

# Make a GET request to the HTTPS server
response = requests.get("https://localhost:4443", verify=False)
print("Server response:", response.text)
```

4. Run the Project

Start the HTTPS server:

```
python server.py
```

Run the HTTPS client in another terminal:

```
python -m venv env && source env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

python client.py
```

You should see the server's response printed in the client's terminal.

### Concepts You'll Learn

TLS Certificates:

Understand the role of certificates and private keys.
Learn the difference between self-signed certificates and certificates signed by a Certificate Authority (CA).
Encryption:

How TLS encrypts data to ensure confidentiality.
Authentication:

How TLS uses certificates to authenticate the server (and optionally the client).
Data Integrity:

How TLS ensures that data is not tampered with during transmission.

### Next Steps

Add Mutual Authentication:

Configure the server to require a client certificate and modify the client to provide one.
Use a Certificate Authority (CA):

Create a local CA to sign certificates instead of using a self-signed certificate.
Explore TLS Versions:

Experiment with different TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3) and understand their differences.
Integrate with a Real Application:

Use TLS in a real-world application, such as a RESTful API or a web application.

_This sandbox project is an excellent starting point to understand the basics of TLS and how it secures communication over the internet._

## scripted answer

`run.sh` script will generate a private key, a certificate for `localhost`,
start an http server and an http client

this http client will download html content from the server, download it, and
open your default web browser to show you

## FAQ

### how can i make SSL connection fail?

set your Certificate expiry to `-1`days
